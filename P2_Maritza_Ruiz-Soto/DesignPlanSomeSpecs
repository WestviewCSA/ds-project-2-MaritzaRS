Design Plan - P2
Due: 3/12/25 11:59pm

After reading the specs, start populating
a list of things you think you might have
to do to finish the project.



Prompt: Wolverine is looking for a diamond 
in the Torrey Pines State Reserve. He's going through
a maze and needs guidance.

Objectives Summarized:
Implement an algorithm per spec in java
Use java stack, queue, 2D/3D arrays, classes
Use test case and file i/o
Develop solution for the prompt


Initial thoughts:
Frustratingly vague.
Help a character get through the maze, like you
tried for the animal crossing project.
I will need some loops, likely using a variable
in placement inside of a 2D array.
However, the likely thinking is that instead of 
using a variable, I will use a Node as a complex
character model.
I will need the stack and queue to figure out 
when and where the diamond is and how the 
Wolverine needs to traverse it. 
Actually, maybe I should read the actual specs


Some things to remember:
	- Need to change the "." to a "+" to indicate the path taken
	- Consider appropriate Run Time
	- Choose either stack or queue
	- Stick with the 2D arrays
	- Hold off on Command Line Arguments
	- Free to use any routing approach, but it must be faster than
	  queue runtime + stack-based approaches
	- Can use a text map or an integer based map
	  -> 1# = rows, 2# = cols, 3# = # of mazes
	- Could also create a multiple room levels

Wise Guidance from Teacher David:
1) read the specs - understand the problem
2) Understand map-based input files
3) GOAL: To either escape or find the diamond


Thus, I need these steps:
1) Create a Node model for the Wolverine (in the form of a Node).
2) Create a 2D array to store the Maze.
3) Use stacks/queue (?) to traverse the each row/col.
4) Create a run time system in seconds
5) Create a Test File for corner cases or errors
6) 


Some stuff:
Need to create a separate array list in order to 
		 * look at and collect the coordinates and movements
		 * Starts with a "+" in the first col
		 * then it provides 3 ints
		 * to row moved, to col moved, and level of maze
		 
		 
		 
		 
		 Notes :
		 char contains a single letter or character

3/12 Notes:
	- Today's focus is map-reading
	- Otherwise known as being able to check each row/col of the map
	- The slash is essentially a door to the next maze room
	- What are the numbers in the Maze???
