Design Plan - P2
Due: 3/12/25 11:59pm

After reading the specs, start populating
a list of things you think you might have
to do to finish the project.



Prompt: Wolverine is looking for a diamond 
in the Torrey Pines State Reserve. He's going through
a maze and needs guidance.

Objectives Summarized:
Implement an algorithm per spec in java
Use java stack, queue, 2D/3D arrays, classes
Use test case and file i/o
Develop solution for the prompt


Initial thoughts:
Frustratingly vague.
Help a character get through the maze, like you
tried for the animal crossing project.
I will need some loops, likely using a variable
in placement inside of a 2D array.
However, the likely thinking is that instead of 
using a variable, I will use a Node as a complex
character model.
I will need the stack and queue to figure out 
when and where the diamond is and how the 
Wolverine needs to traverse it. 
Actually, maybe I should read the actual specs


Some things to remember:
	- Need to change the "." to a "+" to indicate the path taken
	- Consider appropriate Run Time
	- Choose either stack or queue
	- Stick with the 2D arrays
	- Hold off on Command Line Arguments
	- Free to use any routing approach, but it must be faster than
	  queue runtime + stack-based approaches
	- Can use a text map or an integer based map
	  -> 1# = rows, 2# = cols, 3# = # of mazes
	- Could also create a multiple room levels

Wise Guidance from Teacher David:
1) read the specs - understand the problem
2) Understand map-based input files
3) GOAL: To either escape or find the diamond


Thus, I need these steps:
1) Create a Node model for the Wolverine (in the form of a Node).
2) Create a 2D array to store the Maze.
3) Use stacks/queue (?) to traverse the each row/col.
4) Create a run time system in seconds
5) Create a Test File for corner cases or errors
6) 


Some stuff:
Need to create a separate array list in order to 
		 * look at and collect the coordinates and movements
		 * Starts with a "+" in the first col
		 * then it provides 3 ints
		 * to row moved, to col moved, and level of maze
		 

3/12 Notes:
	- Today's focus is map-reading
	- Otherwise known as being able to check each row/col of the map
	- The slash is essentially a door to the next maze room
	- What are the numbers in the Maze???
	
	
3/13 Notes:
	- Objective: continue with map based input, and move to coordinate based
	- The point of the coordinate system is likely to assume what moves have 
	  been made, similar to chess
	- It essentially creates another (?) array with each row being a move. 
	- Map char,  Row,  Col,  Maze "Level"
	- It looks like we can choose one or the other to print out (?)
	- It's best to leave the portal and levels for another day.
	- What the flip, am I actually kind of getting the assignment???????
	- Here are some things that might be useful to the cause:
		  Delimiter: 
		  Can allow the system to ignore certain input
		  Thinking about use for ignoring the text in 1_FromSpecs
		  or other mazes using out of allowed bounds
		  
		  try:
		  can be used to try a segment of code,
		  as long as able to be run, and "catch" and exception 
		  if otherwise
		  
		  char:
		  data type to store a single character, in quote marks

3/14 Notes: 
	- What a great day to be alive
	- Obj: map reading file input - likely using scanner
	- try coordinate based if can
	- I have no freaking clue what I'm doing, but I'm in good company
	- If I thought about using readMap to be able to also add the character to
	  the coord ArrayList but that's proving to be difficult
	- Now I'm making another method in order to add to the ArrayList
	- But what if I were to use another method of class instead of ArrayList
	  so that I can bypass the printing issues?
	- I've already tried queue, but it requires a Tile parameter, which is
	  abstract and very much not a system I should use for the coord
	- Array is very rigid in what it can take in, not to mention if I were to 
	  mix String and int into the function.
	- Man, I haven't even gotten to the door ways yet.
	- Anyways, I need a system of storing these values without complecating things
	- Oh frick, I'm describing a 2D array, am I?
	- But the problem with that thing is that it's so rigid.
	- I need as many rows as there are characters in the thing (which shouldn't
	  be too hard or a problem).
	- Eh, let's give it a try.

3/19 Notes:
	- It's my brother's birthday!!! So happy to call him old.
	- Anyways, it's been  while since I last worked here.
	- Obj: Be able to add a coordinate point to coord ArrayList
	- What do I need to do for impossible method?
		- can I use it as a condition for other methods?
		- What about using it as an idkkkkkkkkkkkkk.
